                <p>Since the last century we delighted in rafting, with our family as culture between us we created a
                    project that brings
                    people together through adventures, helping family members, friends and outside people to come and
                    enjoy through the largest rivers and secure procedures itself.
                    At the beginning it seemed impossible to grow up but during our revelations to enhance food
                    cultures,
                    bring foreign people, where we were becoming better than before, and we are proud of our journey
                    today.
                    We discovered the best guides and sights in the mountains, when we were younger we liked to go to
                    mountains, long hiking trails, get wet and more.
                    We discovered and beheld sights a lot,
                    it encourages us to acquire a spirit of trials and a spirit of amusement rivers within us.

                    Rafting increases our stamina and our love each other due to it is outside activity and summer
                    activity where we involve important parts of our metabolisms and our physic and our flexibility, it
                    requires strong muscles and be care at time to paddling.
