            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 1957, Welcome to Michael Expeditions! Since 1957, we have been passionate about providing
                unforgettable rafting adventures. We discovered the best guides and sights in the mountains. When we
                were younger, we liked to go to mountains, long hiking trails, get wet and more.
                For thrill-seekers and nature lovers alike, our confident and experienced guides ensure safety and fun
                as you explore breathtaking rivers and stunning landscapes. Join us for an adventure of a lifetime!
