    <h3>
        Portland, Oregon
        </h1>

        <p>
            I love Portland, Oregon, because of it's lush green color that exists year-round due to evergreeen trees and
            an insane amount of rain nearly all year long. Additionally, Portland is beautiful because it has a backdrop
            of rolling hills and Mt. Hood.


        </p>
        The Portland Oregon Temple is my favorite temple and it is located just south of portland. The Portland Temple
        holds a
        special place in
        my heart because that is where i was sealed to my wonderful spouse 19 years ago.
